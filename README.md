NEW! Now you can use the keyboard shortcut "$" instead of clicking the Unsubscribe Button in your address bar.  Boom!

* Is your inbox overloaded with marketing e-newsletters?
* Tired of spending too much of your PRECIOUS working hours trying to find how to unsubscribe from every unwanted e-subscription?
* Sick of SCROLLING to the bottom of e-messages just to squint your eyes reading TINY text searching for HIDDEN unsubscribe links at the bottom of emails?

"Unsubscribe Button" (TM) for Chrome adds an easy to use, ONE TAP unsubscribe button to your address bar whenever you browse your Gmail messages.

Try it today, for FREE, and save yourself uncountable hours of vexation.

New in v 1.0.6: if Gmail provides an unsubscribe button at top of email, this extension will first try to use that, preventing you from having to visit a 3rd party website to complete the unsubscribe.
